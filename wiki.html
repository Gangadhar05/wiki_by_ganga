	<PRE>Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures 
single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. Its hardware products are licensed under a 
CC BY-SA license, while the software is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License
 (GPL),[1] permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available 
commercially from the official website or through authorized distributors.[2]

Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog
 input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other
 circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are 
also used for loading programs. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages(Embedded C), 
using a standard API which is also known as the Arduino Programming Language, inspired by the Processing language and used with 
a modified version of the Processing IDE. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an 
integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool developed in Go.

The Arduino project began in 2005 as a tool for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, Italy,[3] aiming to provide a 
low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and 
actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats, and motion detectors.

The name Arduino comes from a bar in Ivrea, Italy, where some of the project's founders used to meet. The bar was named after Arduino
 of Ivrea, who was the margrave of the March of Ivrea and King of Italy from 1002 to 1014.</PRE>
